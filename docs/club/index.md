## Club Structure

The Victoria Engineering Club is unique among all clubs at VUW in that in functions as a collective. This means that the board for VEC focuses on the general direction of the club while specialist clubs within VEC are responsible for specific areas.

## Constitution

The one document to rule them all is our constitution which is the legal document that defines the club. It is a living document and frequently receives modifications at our Annual General Meeting.
