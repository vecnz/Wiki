# Handover

One of the most important times of year is our AGM and the associated handover processes that occur. This document outlines the process for the handover of the club from the current board to the new board.

## Tasks before AGM
Before the AGM several tasks should be finished by the board in preparation for the handover. These tasks include:
- Updating handover documents for all positions
- Working with clubs in the collective to support their handover

## Annual General Meeting
Handover planning begins at the start of Semester 2 with the initial planning and organising of the AGM. The current board will be responsible for organising the AGM and the handover process. In organising the AGM as per the [constitution]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Le_57K9CogDMoSCBYt03LQOrCirJGqtxXArxTZgYdNA/view)), the current board will be responsible for:
- Secretary organising the AGM
- President writing presidents report
- Treasurer presenting financial report
- Secretary calling for nominations for the board at least 2 weeks before the AGM
- Secretary sending out the agenda and all candidate details 1 week before the AGM

## Handover
Once the AGM has been completed, the new board will take over the club. In order to ensure a smooth transition the Handover period lasts until the end of Semester 2 finishing on the Friday of Week 12. This handover period has the previous board continuing to operate in their positions alongside the new board, this does not mean the old board still has the authority of those positions as that rests solely with the new board.

### President
Handover should occur immediately after the AGM and continue until the end of the semester. The goal is to bring the new President up to speed with them able to take over all events in weeks 11/12. The handover should also be done in collaboration with the Vice President due to the close relationship between the roles.
