# VEC Collective

The Victoria Engineering Club is unique among all clubs at VUW in that in functions as a collective. This means that the board for VEC focuses on the general direction of the club while specialist clubs within VEC are responsible for specific areas.


Running clubs inside of a Collective enables us to provide continuity to clubs and allows many of them to exist. The VEC Board focuses on the administration and funding requirements leaving each club in the Collective to focus on what it does best, running awesome events.

## Current Clubs in the Collective
We already have a number of clubs in the Collective all running amazing events!

### Victoria Robotics and Mechatronics (VRAM)
VRAM is a club for people interested in robotics and mechatronics. They run a number of events throughout the year including competing in the VEXU Robotics Competition and the Droid Racing Competition. Alongside their competitions, they also run a number of workshops and speaker events for both the experienced robotics enthusiast and the beginner.

### Victoria SEcurity Club (VSEC)
Comprised of hackers and security enthusiasts, VSEC is a club for people interested in all things security. The source of VECCTF, lockpicking workshops and a number of other events, VSEC is a great place to learn about security and meet like-minded people.

## Starting a New Club

Starting a new club is a great way to get involved with VEC. This new club can target an area that VEC does not already cover or expand on a specialisation. Clubs inside of the Collective do not need to worry about administration or funding as this is all handled by the VEC Board. If you are interested in starting a new club, please contact the VEC President or someone on the board <board@vec.ac.nz>.
