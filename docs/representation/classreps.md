# Class Representatives

## What is a Class Rep?
Class Reps are the bridge between students and the lecturer. They facilitate feedback from the student body to the lecturer and course coordinator. They also help to ensure that the lecturer is aware of any issues that may arise during the course. Class Reps are not there to be unpaid tutors, note takers or to do the lecturer's job. They are there to represent the students and to ensure that the lecturer is aware of any issues that may arise during the course. 

### How to become a Class Rep?
Class Reps should be appointed by week 2 of the course by an in class vote. The lecturer will typically call for nominations in week 1/2 with a vote held in a lecture in week 2. Anyone taking the course can become a Class Rep and the number of Class Reps is decided by the Course Coordinator.

## Getting started as a Class Rep
Congrats on becoming a Class Rep! Here are some things you should do to get started:

### Register with VUWSA
One of the first things you should do is register with VUWSA. This will allow you to access the Class Rep resources and support and is completely free. You can register [here](https://www.vuwsa.org.nz/class-representatives/).

### Training and Resources
A number of resources are available to help you in your role. These include:
- [Class Rep Handbook](https://www.vuwsa.org.nz/s/Class-Rep-Handbook-Final-4mt5.pdf)
- [VUWSA Class Rep Training](https://vuw.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bpFPABPITpqeSJ7)
- [Class Rep Policy](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/documents/policy/academic/class-representative-policy.pdf)

### Join the VEC Class Rep Chat
The VEC Class Rep Chat is a great place to get support and advice from other Class Reps. If you are a Class Rep in a course inside of the Faculty of Engineering (School of Engineering and Computer Science + School of Mathematics and Statistics), we have a dedicated space inside of our Discord server where you can chat to other Class Reps and our Representation team. You can join the chat [here](https://discord.gg/vec) and once on the server run `/addrole` to get the Class Rep role.

### Discord Servers
One of the primary ways students communicate during their course is with a course Discord server. As Class Rep you are responsible for creating the Course Discord server and inviting all students to it. You can use the [Course Discord Server Template](https://discord.new/5usPPTG7EVyM) as a template for your server. You should then invite all students, tutors and the lecturer to the server, this should be accomplished by emailing the course coordinator and asking them to invite all students to the server. Once the server is setup you should invite [VicVerify](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=953504345800982598&permissions=268435460&scope=applications.commands%20bot) which will make sure only students are able to join the server which prevents trolls from joining, further info can be found at the [docs](../services/vicverify.html). You should also restrict the server to only allow the created Faculty and Student roles from posting in the server.
