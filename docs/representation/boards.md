# Boards
Several boards exist that students have representation on from VUWSA boards such as the Student Assembly to Faculty Board.

## VUWSA

### Student Assembly
The Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington Student Assembly and Te Kaunihera o NgƒÅ Tauira consists of student representatives from across the University. These students come form representative groups and faculty representative groups and collectively represent all students at VUW. This is the main representative board for VUWSA with all major decisions brought up at the assembly. Further details and official documents can be found [here](https://www.vuwsa.org.nz/student-assembly).

### Student Academic Committee
Focused on academics the Student Academic Committee reports back to the Student Assembly on academic issues and decisions. The Student Academic Committee consists of members of Faculty Representative groups and is chaired by the VUWSA Academic exec.

## Faculty

### Faculty Board
Each Faculty has a board consisting of all members of staff. This board is responsible for decisions affecting the entire faculty and is chaired by the Dean of the Faculty. Faculty Representative Groups have a seat on this committee as does VUWSA.

### Faculty Learning and Teaching Committee
As a committee of the Faculty Board the Learning and Teaching Committee focuses on decisions on learning and teaching such as Dual Learning. The committee consists of a group of lecturers and has representation from the Faculty Rep group and VUWSA.
