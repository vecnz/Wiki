# Representation

## VEC Representation
As the official Faculty Representative Group, VEC represents all students in the Faculty of Engineering covering the School of Engineering and Computer Science and the School of Mathematics and Statistics. We work closely with VUWSA in advocating for the interests of students in the Faculty of Engineering. Focusing on the issues that matter to students in the Faculty we have members of our team sitting on the:
- Faculty Board
- Faculty Learning and Teaching Committee
- Students Assembly
- Student Academic Committee

Mainly we focus on issues that effect students within the Faculty such as changes to Dual Learning, Diversity, and the Student Experience. We also work closely with the Faculty to ensure that the student voice is heard in the Faculty and that the Faculty is aware of the issues that students face.
