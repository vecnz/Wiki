# VecBot

VecBot is our Discord bot for our community. It is currently used to help administer the server but we are looking to expand its functionality in the future.

## Commands

### `/addrole` and `/removerole`
These commands allow you to join and leave roles. These roles consist of announcements for clubs in the VEC Collective or for types of events such as `Social Events`. In order to join these roles you must be verified.
