## Sponsors

### Sponsorship Process
The sponsorship process is fairly straightforward with the main focus being on communicating with the sponsor and ensuring that they are happy with the arrangement. There is not a specific process for this, but the following steps are recommended:

1. **Identify a sponsor**. This can be done by contacting a company directly or through a contact with the company. The sponsor should be a company that is relevant to the event and is willing to pay for the sponsorship.
2. Talk to the company about what areas of VEC they are interested in, how much they want to fund and what they want in return. This can be done in person or over the phone/email.
3. Finalise the details of the sponsorship. This includes the amount of money that the company is willing to pay, what they want in return and what they want to be advertised. The payment should be handled by the treasurer.

Once the process is all finished it is the job of the Secretary to keep in contact with them and ensure that they are happy with the arrangement. The president should also reach out to the sponsor to thank them for their support.

### Sponsorship Levels
Currently VEC has 3 levels of sponsorship:
- **Bronze**: $500
- **Silver**: $1000
- **Gold**: $3000
