# Engagement
Engagement is how we engage with our members, share and promote our events and grow our community. This is done through a variety of mediums including our website, social media, email and in person.

## How it works
Engagement is essential to VEC as it keeps us in touch with our members and allows us to share our events and activities with them. It also allows us to grow our community and attract new members. We have a dedicated board member who is responsible for Engagement and they run a team of volunteers who help. Engagement is typically done at the VEC level with clubs in the Collective typically going through VEC to get the greatest possible reach, this also lowers the work requirements for them.


## Mediums for Engagement
There are several different mediums for engagement. Each medium has its own strengths and weaknesses and can reach different audiences.

### Posters
The main way of in person advertising on campus is through posters. Each event creates its own posters with assistance from the Engagement Team and manages distribution of the posters. The clubs department has provided spaces for posters across the campus with these been the **only** places posters are to be put up. VEC also has 2 locations in the 2nd floor Comp Labs where a single poster can be located. Only 10 posters are required as this will allow 1 poster per board throughout the hub, cotton and am areas. Once the event has passed the posters must be removed. Posters should be put up by the team running the event and taken down by them.

### Mailing List
One of the ways we keep our members up to date is through a monthly mailing list. We use [mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) to manage our mailing list. The mailing list is used to provide an overview of upcoming events for the next month and to keep members up to date. The mailing list is managed by the Engagement Lead and their team with any details to be added to the mailing list going through them.

### Social Media
Social media is a great way to reach a large audience and is a great way to promote our events. We have a number of social media accounts that we use to promote our events and keep our members up to date. These include:
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VictoriaEngineeringClub/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vec_nz)

The Engagement Lead and their team are responsible for managing these accounts and posting content. Content typically consists of details of upcoming events or information useful to VEC members.


### Discord
Our main online hub is our discord server. This is where we have our main chat and where we share information. The Engagement Lead and their team are responsible for managing the discord server and ensuring it is kept up to date. The discord server is also used to promote events and share information. Events can be posted in the `#events` channel by any member of the organising team and should ping the related groups such as `Social Events`. A Discord Event should also be created with the details of the event to help with an indication of who will attend and to provide an easy to look at list of upcoming events.
