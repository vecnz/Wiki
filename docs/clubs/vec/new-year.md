# New Year
These are tasks that need to be done at the start of the year and before the start of Trimester 1.

## New Member Registration
Every year everyone has to re-register as a member of VEC. This is done by a form that exists in the welcome channel of the discord and on the website. An example form is: https://forms.gle/ooUf1NSCgUJV8h4H9. The form should be updated in all locations it exists and also sent out on the mailing list. The form should be updated to reflect the current year and once it has at least 75 responses a copy should be shared with the clubs department. The mailing list should also be updated to only include people on the form.

## Call for new Organising Team members
A good thing for the start of the year is to call for new people to join the Organising teams of the clubs in the VEC Collective and the related groups such as the Tech Team, Rep Team and others. This can be done by sending out a message on the mailing list and in the discord. The message should include a description of the role and a link to the application form.
