# Wiki

## About
A single wiki for students at VUW. This encompasses several areas:
- Victoria Engineering Club projects and services
- Representation including resources for Class Reps
- VEC Club resources including our handover and event management guides
- University resources

## Contributing
We would love any contributions to any area of our wiki even if you aren't a member of VEC as it's an open wiki for all of VUW. There's a [contribution guide](https://github.com/vecnz/wiki/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) you should read once you decide on what you want to contribute.
